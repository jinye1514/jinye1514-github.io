        <p align="right">May 2024 - Current</p>
        <p>
            Every year, hundreds to thousands of satellites are launched into space. However, once these satellites are launched, 
            they have limited fuel in their attitude control systems and they become effectively defunct when its fuel runs out, losing any orbital control capabilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to this challenge, Northrop Grumman (NG) has developed the Mission Extension Pod (MEP), a 'piggyback' satellite that can dock with a defunct satellite,
            and provide orbital control capabilities to extend the satellite's operational life. The MEP docks with the client satellite by inserting a probe into 
            the Liquid Apogee Engine (LAE) nozzle of the client satellite. Along with the Mission Robotic Vehicle (MRV), 
            which is equipped with a 7-DOF robotic arm. NG has shown initial success in capturing relatively stationary client satellites.
        </p>
        <p>
           Carnegie Mellon University's Biorobotics Lab is collaborating with NG to develop the MRV's control system to further improve their capabilities to capture tumbling client satellites.
            Specifically, as the client satellite tumbles, contact becomes unavoidable between the probe and the nozzle. Because contact dynamics are highly nonlinear, and difficult to model,
            our team has developed a hardware emulator named Holodeck to generate real contact data to be used for evaluating the control system of the MRV in simulated space environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the summer of 2024, I have been working extensively on the Holodeck project. I have been a key contributor to our custom ROS interface for syncronous control of the 28 DOF of the Holodeck emulator,
            and I have spearheaded the development of the emulator software to convert insertion simulation motion to real hardware motion of the Holodeck. In addition, I have created demonstrations of the Holodeck for the NG team, and 
            for CMU faculty and students.
